<p>I have remote working for almost 4 years. It can be boring and exhausting when you get used to doing your work every day from home. until I decide to go to the gym...</p>
<p>Connecting with other people makes us feel good. When I was isolated at home, my connection was limited to my colleagues (remotely), a few friends outside, and most of my time at home. After months of procrastination, finally I went to the nearest gym. All of my hope was to connect with other places and people. It was great to find new cool friends there, plus it drops lots of dopamine in my body and I feel so sarzende and energetic in my work. I feel better about my body since I practice 4 days a week and almost for 2 months! Congrats to myself for this decision.</p>

<p>Imagine the Spotify app has a learning feature for language learners based on the lyrics and podcast transcripts.<br>
I've used the Snipd app, totally love the AI features and I want to practice English with it, But haven't any learning features. I would like to add the learning feature to Spotify because it going to be much more fun if you learn through English music and podcasts. I can review words in the song or in the podcast in audio-based flashcards!<br>
with AI it is possible to generate a cool image to visualize it in a fun way! Also, I can talk with the AR bot about the vocabs I would like to learn, fantastic one! üòÅ</p>

<p>All of us use social apps daily, we'll check them when there is no reason to check just we used to check them regularly. they shape us a habbit to use it without thinking. so it's neccsseary to stay away from them even for a one day a week, I do it in weekend, this called dopamine detax, I try to minimize my useage of internet, my iPhone and macbook. it help us to remove all of sams from our brain. I digital minimalist book, and it's hightly recommended. Remember to use you electronic devieces and apps intentionaly and with a goal in mind.<br>
I try to have offline hours everyday for myself, to think and relect on my toughts. here is what I do in the offline hours:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read a book</li>
<li>Pick a pen and paper and write down all of your thoughts non-stop</li>
<li>Take a shower</li>
<li>Clean up your desk and home</li>
<li>Visualize the feature</li>
<li>Write down your wishlist</li>
<li>Walk out</li>
<li>Do a workout</li>

<p>Today I learned to trust God. You may have small, tiny plans for yourselves but god has better greater plans for me and you! So don‚Äôt let stress and anxiety of what will happen in the future for me, if this going happen so oh my god, that‚Äôs gonna be bad for me. You make the hell inside your mind and you make it even worse by overthinking about features! Oh, my dear friend don‚Äôt do that with yourself, don‚Äôt kill yourself in your handmade hell üòÅ.</p>
<p>Stay relaxed and review your past you had amazing opportunities in your life all of them happened and you can‚Äôt find out why! Yes, it‚Äôs kind of a random event, but I tell you that‚Äôs god's plan because it‚Äôs better than yours so that may bother you. All of you have to trust god for his plan for you. If something does not happen right now, because god knows when and where this event should be occur to you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•üòâ</p>

<p>We are knowledge workers. we deal with lots of information every day it's vital to manage our personal information to be successful as a designer. recently I randomly found a YouTube video about how building a second brain him life organized and easier. I'm a huge fan of staying organized and being productive. Tiago Forte the author of &quot;Building second brain&quot; invented a system called CODE. It's similar to the double diamond (a design thinking framework):<br>
<strong>Capture</strong>, what resonates with you,<br>
<strong>Organize</strong> based on actionability,<br>
<strong>Distil</strong> the information, tell it in your language, and finally<br>
<strong>Express</strong> it, tell a new story to the world, share what you learned<br>
It's basically a note-taking system that helps me stay organized I used Apple Note and then I switched to Obsidiab. It's a life changer idea, highly recommend it!</p>
<h3 id="day-06-%C2%B7-building-a-second-brain---capture-%26-organize" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-06-%C2%B7-building-a-second-brain---capture-%26-organize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Day 06 ¬∑ Building a second brain - Capture &amp; Organize</a></h3>
<p>Tonight I‚Äôd like to write about the details of building a second brain, a note taking system for organizing and managing personal information.<br>
You basically capture 2-3 interesting ideas, which can be surprising, inspiring, or personal like journaling. On weekends or any time, you feel it‚Äôs time to organize your notes. In your note taking app you create folders with the PARA method:</p>
<ol>
<li>Projects: the most actionable</li>
<li>Areas</li>
<li>Resources</li>
<li>Archive</li>
</ol>
<p>List your 10-15 active projects, every project has a goal and a deadline. Otherwise, we call Area, like health, finance, parenting, etc. which is your area of responsibility. Anything that is useful for the feature goes to your resources folder. The last one is for archiving your inactive projects. Tomorrow I write about the other 2 stages.</p>
<h3 id="day-06-%C2%B7-building-a-second-brain---distill-%26-express" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-06-%C2%B7-building-a-second-brain---distill-%26-express" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Day 06 ¬∑ Building a second brain - Distill &amp; Express</a></h3>
<p>After taking notes for your projects and organizing them with the PARA method. It‚Äôs time to distill them. Summarize and highlight what‚Äôs important. The author used a 4 layer metaphor:</p>
<ol>
<li>The soil: your scraped notes</li>
<li>The oil: make bold what‚Äôs important</li>
<li>The gold: highlight the bold text</li>
<li>The gym: write down a summary based on highlights.<br>
Finally, it‚Äôs time to use this information to tell your story, inspire others, and create value. What‚Äôs the point of knowing something, if you collect notes and nobody, even yourself can‚Äôt utilize it. So share your work and get feedback regularly. You can change lives by sharing yourself with others.</li>
</ol>

<p>I just opened the Apple Podcast app and scrolled to find a random episode to listen to while I do my work. One of them caught my eye which was about problem-solving. Wow as a designer I am always curious about this kind of skill. He talked about lots of ways to become better problem solvers in our lives.<br>
Here is my tip for TIL (today I learned...) üìù write down your problem in 100 words. Then try to describe it in 400 and 900 words, and finally magic ‚ú® will happen. you solve your problem by yourself. This is the magic of problem clarification. Write more about your challenge eventually, you'll find the solution/s inside it! You can try to write down 900 words, but 900 is not a magic number write till you'll find the solution.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been a designer since almost 4 years ago. But let's flashback to the past and see how my design adventure started üòÅ. When I was a kid I went to my cousin, he was a computer geek and kind of programmer. Always I have fun in their house most of the time by playing games like IGA, FIFA 2002, chickens, and more. As I grew up, I became more curious about computers, one day I explored random places on Earth and I was amazed about how and who made this, I know it‚Äôs from Google. He taught me web design and development with Dreamviewer üôÉ<br>
I started to have my blog. I tried to customize the blog template by self-learning HTML and then CSS. It was an amazing experience I enjoyed a lot. At that time it was very common to design ad banners. So I found it very interesting and I designed some banners for my blog and forum! Tomorrow I will talk about how university changed my life!</p>
<h3 id="day-09-%C2%B7-how-i-became-a-developer-then-a-designer%2C-part-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-09-%C2%B7-how-i-became-a-developer-then-a-designer%2C-part-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Day 09 ¬∑ How I became a Developer then a Designer, part 2</a></h3>
<p>In 2012 I went to university to study software engineering, l was full of amazing dreams for my future. But it was heartbreaking üíî to see there are a lot of courses not related to software. I decided to keep focus on courses that are relevant. I found a great friend with the same mindset and we tried to learn web development in the summer of 2013. We‚Äôre super enthusiastic ü§© to learn as fast as possible. I want to work on front-end development and he focused on the backend. I remember the first project we worked on was a clinic website. Then I fell a love with Bootstrap Framework 2,3, and 4 üòÇ. Then we work on a forum website and after that, an e-commerce online shop. Full of energy we eat every article, book, and video course to absorb all that lovely stuff. I also learned to use Linux and Git from other cool guys. Also, we share what we‚Äôve learned as self-thought persons with our classmates. It was a very exciting experience as a web designer teacher.</p>
<h3 id="day-10-%C2%B7-how-i-became-a-developer-then-a-designer%2C-part-3%2F3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#day-10-%C2%B7-how-i-became-a-developer-then-a-designer%2C-part-3%2F3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Day 10 ¬∑ How I became a Developer then a Designer, part 3/3</a></h3>
<p>In the last term of university, I went to a company to work as a front-end developer. It was a pretty cool experience I learned a lot. After 4 months I decided to come back and study for my master's exam. I did it after almost 4 months I earned a rank of 142 among thousands of people. That was a great success in my life because now I can go to Tehran (the capital of Iran) and have a place almost for free, and work and find connections. I started working with a company inside our university it wasn't good enough. Again my friend joined Sepidz as a developer and designer. day after day I realized that design was better for me then I smoothly switched to becoming a designer.</p>
<p>I picked interaction foundation courses to learn the fundamentals of UX design and design thinking. I learned a lot and really grew up with hard work. At the beginning of the pandemic I came back home with a master's degree and a great connection led me to my next job at the biggest software development company in Iran. with the designer manager, we started to work on a super huge design system for enterprise and complex CRMs. It was nice and challenging but it's time to go to the military for 2 years! Oh no, but I found a startup in the US and totally changed my life! I bought a new MacBook Pro and all the cool things. After the military, I came back to the system group and in their sub-company, cloud-based services. Abramad, as I work for almost 7 months there!</p>

<p>Remote work looks appealing on social media and in YouTube videos. The images of lounging on the beach, enjoying a sunny day, making money, and sipping orange juice create an enticing narrative. However, the reality is different. Yes, I work from home and stay connected with my family, but after months, spending nearly 24 hours at home becomes frustrating and exhausting. I miss my passion for work, and on some days, I accomplish almost nothing.</p>
<p>When I chose this lifestyle, I knew I had to make changes to be happier and more productive. Here are the tips I'd like to share with you:</p>
<p><strong>üö∂üèª Morning Walks</strong>: Every morning, I make it a point to go out for a 30-minute walk and buy fresh bread for breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>‚è≤Ô∏è Pomodoro Technique</strong>: I've embraced the Pomodoro technique to stay focused at work. It's a game-changer, allowing me to take breaks for renewed energy during and after work.</p>
<p><strong>üìö Establishing Habits</strong>: Creating daily habits has been key to feeling great at the start and end of my day. From staying hydrated to combining a &quot;PodWalk&quot; (listening to podcasts while walking) and reading non-fiction books.</p>
<p><strong>üí™ Gym Sessions</strong>: The gym has become more than just a place to work out; it's where I reconnect with school friends, fostering greater happiness and energy levels. You can read more about this in Day 02 (link üîù).</p>
<p><strong>‚òï Virtual Coffee Time</strong>: I've recommended to my colleagues to incorporate casual time for discussions about everything except work.</p>
<p>I strive to make each day better and nurture the dream of someday working from the beach. ‚ú®‚õ±Ô∏èüòÅ</p>
