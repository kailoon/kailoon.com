Developers moved to modern web development (<a href=\"https://jamstack.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JAMstack</a>) and become more specialised. There are now front-end, backend and full-stack web development stacks. I believe, front-end web development became the automatic choice for most developers with designer background.</p>\n<p>Other than that, WordPress evolved from a simple blogging platform to a <a href=\"https://fullsiteediting.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">full-site-editing CMS</a> (soon). We kinda see that coming. After years of reviewing on ThemeForest, the demands for a full fledge CMS from WordPress are increasing and page builder is gaining popularity since the introduction of <a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/visual-composer-page-builder-for-wordpress/242431\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">WPBakery</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"static-site-generators\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#static-site-generators\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Static Site Generators</a></h3>\n<p>I first encountered SSG back in 2017. I forgot the reason why I get into SSG but once I get started, I cannot stop. I tried <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gatsby</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hugo</a> but 11ty became my favourite.</p>\n<p>What fascinate me is the fact that we are using basic HTML/CSS again for building websites. This might sound like a return to the old ways of making sites but there are some key differences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SSG has improved over the years. You can basically get a site running within minutes.</li>\n<li>Different templating languages to choose from. Choose the one you like and go nuts.</li>\n<li>Automation became mainstream.</li>\n<li>It is secured, easy to scale and the performance is insane. These are also my main reasons of using SSG.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>SSG</strong> simply makes more sense for most company static websites with minimal interaction or less-frequent content update.</p>\n<h4 id=\"gatsby\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#gatsby\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gatsby</a></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gatsby</a> is my first attempt to the SSG world. Well, I have my personal reason behind this. WordPress started using <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">React</a> for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gutenberg</a> and it's just a good timing to learn React. There is definitely a learning curve when dealing with Gatsby while learning ReactJS at the same time. However, the performance of Gatsby is no doubt one of the best.</p>\n<p>I found this article by <a href=\"https://brycewray.com/posts/2019/07/why-staying-with-hugo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bryce Wray</a> who has the similar struggle or experience with Gatsby. The plugins dependencies and those errors / warnings in the CLI are driving me crazy. There is this <em>uncertainty</em> playing in head every time I install / run a build. Further, I find it is an overkilled to use Gatsby for personal blog.</p>\n<h4 id=\"hugo\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#hugo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hugo</a></h4>\n<p>The thing about <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hugo</a> is that it feels lightweight, I was intrigued by the reported build speed. Site as big as <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/05/switch-wordpress-hugo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SmashingMagazine</a> is build on Hugo, this won't go wrong. So I dive in, having fun building my personal site 2.0 on Hugo using Go's html/template which based on <a href=\"https://golang.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Golang</a>. I'd recommend Hugo to anyone who would like to try SSG, I may still try it for a few small projects in the future.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Archetypes</a> feature is really handy and I really hope I can do the same with 11ty.</p>\n<h4 id=\"11ty\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#11ty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">11ty</a></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Eleventy</a> is fairly new, if comparing to Gatsby and Hugo. It supports plugins and you can write it in multiple template languages, you can pick one or use them all together!</p>\n<p>Eleventy seems to have all the features I wanted ( no archetypes tho ), fast-enough build speed, easy-to-use collections to group content. Further, I can add shortcodes easily for easy content management. The folder system is simple, dummy proof.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-start-2 col-end-10\">\n<figure class=\"mb-10\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mmdsharifi/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,w_400/Screenshot_on_2021-02-14_at_19-06-24.webp\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mmdsharifi/image/upload/dpr_auto,q_auto,w_400/mmdsharifi.com/Screenshot_on_2021-02-14_at_19-06-24.webp 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/mmdsharifi/image/upload/dpr_auto,q_auto,w_600/mmdsharifi.com/Screenshot_on_2021-02-14_at_19-06-24.webp 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/mmdsharifi/image/upload/dpr_auto,q_auto,w_768/mmdsharifi.com/Screenshot_on_2021-02-14_at_19-06-24.webp 768w, https://res.cloudinary.com/mmdsharifi/image/upload/dpr_auto,q_auto,w_820/mmdsharifi.com/Screenshot_on_2021-02-14_at_19-06-24.webp 820w, https://res.cloudinary.com/mmdsharifi/image/upload/dpr_auto,q_auto,w_1240/mmdsharifi.com/Screenshot_on_2021-02-14_at_19-06-24.webp 1240w\" alt=\"google lighthouse score 400\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\"><figcaption class=\"text-center text-sm mt-3 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-200\">The magic 400 on Google Lighthouse.</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-start-3 col-end-9\">\n<p>This site is built with <a href=\"https://github.com/mmdsharifi/mmdsharifi.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">11ty &amp; TailwindCSS</a>.
