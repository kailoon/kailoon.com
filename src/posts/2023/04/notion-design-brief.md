and create a `duplicate` of template to get started!
#### 2) Write it down!

Now you have a brand new template with some question to ask your client. Next you need have a kickoff meeting with your client, to ask him/her questions that I provided in the template.
Feel free to customize it based on your project and needs. Also you can use it like a checklist to consider all aspect of project from background, market, product and design goals, like a pro! 😎
##### Key Sections of a Design Brief

- **Project Information**: quick information about the project
- **Background** Why this project should exist?
- **Market** All about market goals and competitors
- **Product** Vision and mission of product, key UVP (unique value proposition)
- **Users** Know target users, their needs, pain points and goals
- **Design Goals** Design expectation, success indicator for evaluation of the design

For each section, I provided a couple of questions to understand what should ask your client.

{% figure 'design_brief_sections', 'Design Brief Sections', 'Design Brief Sections -- feel free to customize it based on your needs' %}

Before the meeting make sure to review the template and make your questions ready, during the meeting also write answers in your notebook as a draft, while you can record the meeting. (always ask before recording their voice)


Finally, after the meeting, you can rewrite all of the answers in your Notion template as a live document. Might be you need multiple meetings to write your design brief completely.
