#### 2) Calendar a meeting with your client

Now you have a brand new template with some question to ask your client. Next you need have a kickoff meeting with your client, to ask him/her questions that I provided in the template.
Feel free to customize it based on your project and needs. Also you can use it like a checklist to consider all aspect of project from background, market, product and design goals, like a pro! 😎

Before meeting make sure to review the template and make your questions ready, during the meeting also write answers on your notebook as a draft, while you can record the meeting. (always ask before record their voice)

Finally, after the meeting you can rewrite all of answers in your Notion template as live document. Might be you need multiple meetings to write your design brief completely.
