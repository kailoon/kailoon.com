### Intro

I would love to levelup my english skills through daily writing. I'll read script of podcasts and then write down my YouTube video scripts, revise them and then practice speaking by making a fun and cool video!
So let's dive in 🏊‍♂️

### Day 01 · Intro script 🚀

I love the mindset mentor podcast by Rob Dial. and I want to just practice very first second of each podcast in my first day, I'm super excited to do it!

"Welcome to today's video of the designer mindset channel. I'm your host Mohammad Sharifi. I you have not done yet, so hit the subscribe button, so that you neve miss another video. if you love this video, please do me a favor, all of you have to do, like and comment down bellew this video. the reason why is because the more likes and comments we get on this video, so YouTube show this video for people never watch it before which alow us to grow and make better video for you. if you do that I'll greatly apperetiate it. Today's topic..."

### Day 02 · Come back to the Gym 💪

I have remote working for almost 4 years. It can be boring and exhausting when you get used to doing your work every day from home. until I decide to go to the gym... 

Connecting with other people makes us feel good. When I was isolated at home, my connection was limited to my colleagues (remotely), a few friends outside, and most of my time at home. After months of procrastination, finally I went to the nearest gym. All of my hope was to connect with other places and people. It was great to find new cool friends there, plus it drops lots of dopamine in my body and I feel so sarzende and energetic in my work. I feel better about my body since I practice 4 days a week and almost for 2 months! Congrats to myself for this decision.

### Day 03 · Spotify Learn 🎧

Imagine the Spotify app has a learning feature for language learners based on the lyrics and podcast transcripts.
I've used the Snipd app, totally love the AI features and I want to practice English with it, But haven't any learning features. I would like to add the learning feature to Spotify because it going to be much more fun if you learn through English music and podcasts. I can review words in the song or in the podcast in audio-based flashcards!
with AI it is possible to generate a cool image to visualize it in a fun way! Also, I can talk with the AR bot about the vocabs I would like to learn, fantastic one! 😁
