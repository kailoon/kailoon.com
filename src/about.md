### About kailoon

I am a freelance front-end designer & developer based in Malaysia. You might remember me as kailoon the reviewer from ThemeForest. I have a bachelor degree in Multimedia & Technology, but everything I know of and on the web today is self-taught. I founded LoonDesign Studio and started providing creative design & web development services since 2008.

I am more of a designer-developer hybrid, or a design-minded front-end developer or [front-end designers](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design/ 'visit site'). I do branding, logo design, graphic design and I also write HTML, CSS, and presentational JavaScript that powers web user interfaces with a focus on responsive design, semantic markup, accessibility, and performance.

- **Standard-compliant**.
- **Optimised for mobile** as I take the mobile-first approach.
- **Fully responsive** as I use custom CSS or TailwindCSS.
- **Cross-browser compatible** and no IE, please.
- **Accessibility**, a product needs to be usable by users of assistive technologies by default, whenever possible.
- **Vanilla Javascript** whenever possible.
- **Optimised for performance** because page speed is google ranking factor.

I work remotely from my home office in Malaysia.

### Now

Right now, I contracted to Envato as a senior reviewer for one of the largest digital marketplaces in the world — [ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net 'goto themeforest'). I have been doing contract works with Envato since 2008, shaping the content library for **ThemeForest** & **Envato Elements**. You might remember me as kailoon the reviewer from ThemeForest.

I also work with companies and clients personally, building web sites and application UIs with a strong focus on **responsive design, accessibility, performance**. Over the years, I have the honour to collaborate with clients ranging from startups to SME. A few of them has grown successfully or getting acquired. Some of my featured clients are **Envato**, **99.co**, **Evercondo**, **MeetPoppy** & **Qbasis**. [Check out my portfolio](https://kailoon.com/works/).
