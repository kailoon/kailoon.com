### Me

I've been in the web industry since 2013. I've got a bachelor's degree in software engineering and a master's in multimedia and technology, but here's the cool part: I've learned everything about the web by myself. I love making stuff on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@designer-mindsethttps://youtube.com/@designer-mindset) and my blog, and I'm always hunting for new ways to learn and get better.

My journey led me from the realm of a front-end developer until the close of 2019, a moment when I heeded the call of my passion. This marked my transformation into a designer. I've gained a wealth of knowledge through Interaction Design Foundation courses and insightful books, shaping me into the professional I am today.

- **User-Centered Design**: apply my design thinking expertise to craft user-focused designs.
- **Solid engineering background**, I create prototypes with code
- **Coding Proficiency**: Fluent in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for seamless design-to-development collaboration.
- **Business-Driven Solutions**: Infusing design with business understanding for successful, user-centric outcomes.
- **Data-Informed Iteration**: Using data insights to refine designs based on user feedback.
- **Collaborative Problem Solver**: Collaborating with diverse teams to create holistic design solutions.

I work remotely from my home office.

### Now

Currently, I'm a senior designer at System Group, the largest software company in Iran. I'm part of their subsidiary, [Abramad Cloud](https://www.linkedin.com/company/abramad). My role involves establishing streamlined design and UX writing processes. I handle research, competitor analysis, and collaborate closely with product managers. Together, we craft comprehensive product requirement documents and I translate them into seamless interfaces.

Moreover, I collaborate directly with developers, ensuring their outputs align perfectly with the design. This meticulous oversight guarantees that every element adheres faithfully to the design standards.

My approach revolves around the **double diamond** design process. It lets me zoom out for the project's big picture, while diving deep into microinteractions. This blend of focus and flexibility ensures high-quality design outcomes with each iteration. You can explore all my work in detail on my [portfolio](https://mmdsharifi.com/works/).

Drop me a line at **KordDesigner [at] gmail** if you have an idea in mind that we can work together. The more details about your project you include in your message, the faster I will get back to you. Youâ€™ll hear back from me within 1 - 3 business days. I look forward to hearing from you. ðŸ™‚
