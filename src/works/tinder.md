### The Client

Tinder (previously Tinder Lab ) is a software development company based in Singapore, it is a subsidiary company for any cool side projects.

### The challenge

The idea of the name, Tinder, to spark off something. It's a fire stater. Therefore, the elements / concept will be something relevant. There are a lot of fire / flame logo out there, it is challenging to make a unique one.

### The Solution

After the brainstorming session, I understand the needs from the client and the target audience. More importantly, the language they would like to use to communicate with the audience.

<div class="col-span-full md:grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-1">

{% figure 'tinder-guidelines', 'logo guidelines', 'logo guidelines and variants' %}

{% figure 'tinder-guidelines-horizontal', 'logo guidelines horizontal', 'horizontal logo guidelines' %}

</div>

<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

We experimented by using both geometric and organic shapes along with lab elements. ( I’d lost my initial sketches as this is a pretty old project, but one of my favourite) The result is clear, the organic shapes contained within a geometric device communicates clearly and accurately. It is easily recognisable.

### The Result

After a few round of discussion with the client, we actually make the decision to go with this due to it’s boldness and simplicity.
