### The Client

Collis is the CEO of [Envato](https://envato.com 'visit external website'). Back in 2011, I am honoured with the opportunity to redesign and expand the digital marketplaces by Envato. If you can remember Flashden, you'd know what that is.

<div class="col-start-3 col-end-6">

### The challenge

We need to maintain the style consistency throughout the design process using part of an animal body to represent each marketplace. The existing logo is taking too much space and heavily rely on the text in the integration. Considering it is for a marketplace, such logo form could be a distraction for the content viewer.

### The Solution

We come up with a solution that resembles the existing logo styling yet easy to extend to other marketplaces/products. Minimal, subtle but recognisable.

<div class="col-start-2 col-end-10">

{% figure 'envato-flashden','from flashden to activeden', 'first logo redesign, from flashden to activeden ' %}

</div>
<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

### The Result

After the first redesign, I took the job to extend the branding to other marketplaces, such as **ThemeForest**, **CodeCanyon**, **AudioJungle**, **VideoHive**, **3dOcean**, **PhotoDune** & **GraphicRiver**.
