### The Client

[99.co](http://99.co/) is a map-based property search engine that provides renters, buyers, and agents fast and efficient property search experience. The startup is founded in 2014, based in Singapore and expanded to Indonesia.

### The challenge

I was tasked to improve the mobile user experience in order to increase the conversion leads. At the same time, establish a stronger brand identity throughout the design. The project scope includes the web redesign and iOS app user experience improvements.

I kicked start the web redesign after a few round of brain storming sessions with the client. The process includes:

- Observing users and their behavior in their context, interact with and experience what users experience.
- Defining the problem faced by the client and the users.
- Explore solutions that is possible with the given timeline.
- Prototyping the ideas for testing

Unfortunately, we did not move forward with other pages because the client need to prioritise mobile design update ( this is very common especially for a startup company, agile development, they need to focus what is core to the business). So, we started discussions and meetings for the mobile design.

It is always challenging when dealing with data driven app with such small screen real estate. Once again, I strive for minimalistic and simplicity.

### The Result

My design was not accepted. I am not sure what is the reason, however, this is a special project, because I almost landed a permanent job. After meeting the founder and get to know the office culture, I am excited to have the opportunity to work with such a passionate and energized team.

However, things didn’t turn out as expected. I have to move to Singapore in order to pursue the position and that’s not a good timing as my wife had just giving birth to our first baby boy few months ago. I have chosen my family this time.

After all, this is quite an exciting project as I have the opportunity to work for a promising startup and learn quite a few non-technical things along the journey.
