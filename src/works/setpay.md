### The Solution

We come up with a solution that resembles the existing logo styling yet easy to extend to other marketplaces/products. Minimal, subtle but recognisable.




### The challenge

I was tasked to improve the mobile user experience in order to increase the conversion leads. At the same time, establish a stronger brand identity throughout the design. The project scope includes the web redesign and iOS app user experience improvements.

I kicked start the web redesign after a few round of brain storming sessions with the client. The process includes:

- Observing users and their behavior in their context, interact with and experience what users experience.
- Defining the problem faced by the client and the users.
- Explore solutions that is possible with the given timeline.
- Prototyping the ideas for testing

Unfortunately, we did not move forward with other pages because the client need to prioritise mobile design update ( this is very common especially for a startup company, agile development, they need to focus what is core to the business). So, we started discussions and meetings for the mobile design.

</div>

It is always challenging when dealing with data driven app with such small screen real estate. Once again, I strive for minimalistic and simplicity.

### The Result

My design was not accepted. I am not sure what is the reason, however, this is a special project, because I almost landed a permanent job. After meeting the founder and get to know the office culture, I am excited to have the opportunity to work with such a passionate and energized team.

However, things didn’t turn out as expected. I have to move to Singapore in order to pursue the position and that’s not a good timing as my wife had just giving birth to our first baby boy few months ago. I have chosen my family this time.

After all, this is quite an exciting project as I have the opportunity to work for a promising startup and learn quite a few non-technical things along the journey.
