### The Client

It is a project from a recurring client. We work on a brand identity project previously. This time, the client needs to launch an event management service. The service focuses on audience engagement and fully utilise technology to help user setup event with ease. FlickEvents help businesses by providing insight analytics to help businesses to discover intelligently, to outreach, grow and maintain relationships with each other.

### Branding

Since this is a new product, there isn't much data that we can work with. We did our research by studying a few of our competitors. The goals are:

- To create a logo that's easy to integrate into a banner
- Easy to remember.

</div>

<div class="col-start-2 col-end-10 md:grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-1">

{% figure 'flickevents-exploration', 'logo explorations', 'logo mark explorations' %}

{% figure 'flickevents-mockup', 'logo marks mockup', 'logo marks mockup' %}

</div>

<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

Initially, we try something more 'event' related by using a curtain and pulse as the base elements. Unfortunately, the outcome isn't as expected.

The logo mark looks like something related to show business. It doesn't explain the objective of FlickEvents. So, I continue to explore the possibilities and options for this rebranding project. The idea is to provide a 2-dimensional mark that showcases the perspective of the provided services.

### Web

We took the more direct approach when explaining how FlickEvents work. A shorter header without large hero image and jump straight into **How it works** section. We also provide a nice little section to introduce both of the young founders of FlickEvents.

</div>

<div class="col-start-2 col-end-10">
{% figure 'flickevents-web', 'web design', 'Features and how it works section.' %}
{% figure 'flickevents-about', 'web design', 'The about page.' %}
</div>

<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

### The Result

The client is very happy with result 😀
